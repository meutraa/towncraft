/** @fn int load_drawables(SDL_Renderer* renderer, SDL_Texture*** textures, Drawable** drawables, char* layout_path)
 *  @brief Takes a layout file and fills the textures and drawables arrays.
 *
 *  This function will read a valid layout file and allocate memory for Drawables with the least number of SDL_Textures
 *  required.\n It creates drawables from a layout file with the following format:
 *
 *   path/to/resource\n
 *   600 400\n
 *   800 420\n
 *
 *	@note The first set of numbers is the X and Y co-ordinates of the top left corner of the Drawable on the Window.
 *	@note All sizes are scaled to a resolution of 1280x720, so 1280 is always the very right, and 720 is always the very bottom.
 *
 *  @param renderer the SDL_Renderer used to render textures.
 *  @param textures a pointer to an array of SDL_Texture pointers to fill. 
 *  @param drawables a pointer to an array of drawables to fill.
 *  @note It is not neccesary to allocate the memory for textures and drawables before calling this function.
 *  @param layout_path a relative path to the resource file as a string.
 *  @return the number of Drawables that were created.
 *	@note the texture pointer of the returned Drawables may still be NULL and the SDL_Rects may not have initialised values if the
 *  	function failed to parse any of the layout file.
